LambDynamicLights unofficial flint loader port. DO NOT BOTHER THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS FOR ISSUES!

A dynamic lights mod for flint loader.

</div></center>

## ðŸ“– What's this mod?

It's dark outside, extremely dark...
You can't see a lot in the darkness, you wish you had a torch,
or a lantern to hold and see in the light...

And this is now possible with this mod as it adds dynamic lights to the game.
You can see in the darkness thanks to your torch now!

This mod adds dynamic lights to Minecraft. Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an
item which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.

## ðŸ“– Usage

Using this mod is very simple!

Install it in your mods folder along with [ObsidianUI](https://modrinth.com/mod/obsidianui), (and [Embeddium](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium) if wanted for better performances).

You will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via Forge's Mod List, you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!
You can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/lambdynlights.toml`.

### Build

Just do `./gradlew build` and everything should build just fine!

# ðŸ“– Compatibility
